# Data Visualization Using BigMart Data

## Description

In this project, I conducted an analysis of the Big Mart sales data using various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective of this analysis is to gain valuable insights into the dataset and uncover patterns and trends.

### Data Visualizations

- **Bar Plot**:  
  A bar plot was created to illustrate the **mean sales** for each outlet type.  
  - **X-axis**: Types of outlets (Small, Medium, High)  
  - **Y-axis**: Mean sales  
  This visualization provides a comparative overview of average sales performance by outlet type.

- **Scatter Plot**:  
  A scatter plot was generated to display the **distribution of item weight and item visibility**.  
  - **X-axis**: Item Weight  
  - **Y-axis**: Item Visibility  
  Each point represents an item in the dataset. This plot reveals the relationship and distribution between item weight and visibility, helping to identify potential trends or correlations.

- **Box Plot**:  
  A box plot was constructed using Seaborn to visualize the distribution of the `Item_Outlet_Sales` variable.  
  This plot helps in understanding:
  - Median and quartiles
  - Spread and skewness
  - Outliers in the sales data

These visualizations provide crucial insights:
- The **bar plot** highlights differences in average sales among outlet types.
- The **scatter plot** offers a view into the interaction between item features.
- The **box plot** reveals the spread and anomalies within the sales data.
